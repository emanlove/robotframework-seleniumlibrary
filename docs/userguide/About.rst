The guide is intended to be a pratical how to focuesd on common topics one
encounters using the SeleniumLibrary for web testing with Robot Framework.
It is focused on giving practical advice and/or options on tasks one does
while automating. Less of a definitive bible of how to do things the one
correct way, it will give you both experiences and examples, sometimes
contradictory, covering multiple paths to the same ends.

This guide is a supplement to the keyword documentation. The keyword
documentation should be thought of as a technical reference where as the is,
well .. as titled .. a pratical guide to the SeleniumLibrary.
